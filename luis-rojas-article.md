##Luis Rojas---Brave

Luis Rojas tends to present himself rather modestly. He works a day job as a frontend developer at a private security company, and on the weekends, he enjoys working with technology and relaxing with his family, friends, and a few beers. He's also a die-hard soccer fan and talks a great deal about his passion for the sport. However, this unassuming introduction is quite the deception; a veil hiding the challenging circumstances he has had to survive to get to this point. The very ones that have directly shaped the grand ambitions that led him to pursue studies in web development at Modern Developer.

##La Comarca Lagunera

Hailing from Mexico, Luis was born in Torreón in the north state of Coahuila and has lived in a region called *La Comarca Lagunera* his whole life. He describes life in this city as pleasant, rich with kind people and warm weather. Unfortunately, the city has acted as a bridge for drug trafficking between Mexico and the United States for many years. 

In 2009, the two most powerful drug cartels started a war for control of this bridge, and this made life in the city extremely unsafe. It was a stark change from a normal life where most people were only somewhat aware of such activities going on behind the scenes to facing an all-out war where leaving the house might land you in the middle of the next skirmish. Many innocent people found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time and lost their lives during this time of unrest.

*The Bridge of Ojuela*

This unstable civil situation profoundly impacted the city even beyond the obvious issues of security and quality of life; economics and education suffered greatly as well. Many local businesses closed down due to pressure from the cartels, who wanted to extort money from locals to fund their war. This led to a very risky situation for the honest hard-working people who lived there; failure to cooperate meant risking their lives and the lives of their children. 

Luis’ description of the situation is surreal and offers a great deal of perspective, especially when heard as an observer who has been fortunate to never have had to worry about safety in these terms. Fortunately, in 2013 the situation started improving when the war started dying down for reasons that remain unclear. Life in *La Comarca Lagunera* is slowly returning to normal. Businesses are reopening and the nightlife is returning to how it used to be, leaving residents hopeful of returning to the good old days once again, and it seems that may not be too far in the future.	

##Web Development and Social Entrepreneurship

Luis was introduced to software development when he was in college. At that time, he was programming desktop applications in C++ and confesses that he didn't enjoy it very much. However, he developed an interest in web development when he was interning at the only electrical company in Mexico. He enjoyed using HTML, CSS, and PHP on some of their projects. This opportunity was short-lived as he left the professional web development sphere to pursue a career in an unrelated field for the next five years. During this time, he managed to keep his connection to  web development alive and allow it to flourish by watching tutorials and building pet projects in his spare time. 

In 2014, having witnessed the terrible societal impact that the situation in his city had on the people around him, Luis was inspired to use his programming abilities to help alleviate the social issues around him. He later learned that this is called social entrepreneurship, and he discovered that he had found his true calling in this field.

Luis aims to harness the power of the web to eradicate problems his city faces in the areas of security, economics, and education, among others. He sees the web as a facilitator of change that has been sorely under-utilized in Mexico. The first step of his dream is to organize a platform where professionals from other disciplines---teachers, psychologists, doctors, and other professionals who intimately deal with the needs of the people---can regularly meet up with local software developers to introduce them to the social issues these professionals witness. 

In Luis' vision, the engineers will work with these professionals to design and develop mobile and web applications that creatively address these issues. Quite like a hackathon, but for social entrepreneurs. The goal is to enable the professionals to work more efficiently and effectively focus on solving their respective core issues. They are currently inundated with outdated systems and red tape; a situation that Luis believes can be alleviated by connecting the right people to the right issues. 

He sees this ultimately being turned into a powerful movement, supported by the power of the web. He envisions social entrepreneurs in other locales to also be able to freely share their successes and failures, all of them working together to aid these kinds of developmental efforts.

Keeping that at the forefront of his mind, he patiently works away at his daytime job and the assignments here at Modern Developer. He has a keen understanding that the current illusion of safety in the community may be fleeting, and he is eager to make the most of it while it lasts.

##Soccer and Down Time

In his spare time, Luis likes to relax with his family and friends, and he's quite the soccer aficionado. One of his early dreams was to be a professional soccer player, but despite being praised for his talent on the field, circumstances did not permit him to pursue that dream. These days, he regularly enjoys spending time with his friends playing a variant of traditional soccer called Uruguay soccer, which is played with seven members per team. He is currently enjoying a tournament going on in his city. 

He and two of his best friends also maintain a YouTube channel on which they talk about La Liga MX, a soccer league in Mexico. His sports interests extend beyond soccer, as well. He loves the NFL and his favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys. Roger Federer is his favorite Tennis player, and he also enjoys watching baseball and basketball.

Apart from sports, he also enjoys playing video games and likes brewing his own beer. *"Maybe there's something entrepreneurial I can make out of [the beer] too..."*, he wonders.

When asked about his favorite experiences, he recalls that the most enjoyable experience he had was when he visited the beach with his family for the first time. He dreams of living by the beach some day and experiencing the sand, water, and warm weather in his daily life. With the sheer courage he so casually displays, it's not hard to imagine that these goals of his will one day be fulfilled.
