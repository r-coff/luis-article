##Luis Rojas - Brave

Luis Rojas tends to present himself rather modestly. He works a day job as a frontend developer at a private security company, and on the weekends, he enjoys working with technology and relaxing with his family, friends, and a few beers. He's also a die-hard soccer fan and talks a great deal about his passion for the sport. However, this unassuming introduction is quite the deception; a veil hiding the challenging circumstances he has had to survive to get to this point. The very ones that have directly shaped the grand ambitions that led him to pursue studies in web development at Modern Developer.

##La Comarca Lagunera

Hailing from Mexico, Luis was born in Torreón in the north state of Coahuila and has lived in a region called *La Comarca Lagunera* his whole life. He describes life in this city as pleasant, rich with kind people and warm weather. Unfortunately, the city has acted as a bridge for drug trafficking between Mexico and the United States for many years. 

In 2009, the two most powerful drug cartels started a war for control of this bridge, and this made life in the city extremely unsafe. It was a stark change from a normal life where most people were only somewhat aware of such activities going on behind the scenes to facing an all-out war where leaving the house might land you in the middle of the next skirmish. Many innocent people found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time and lost their lives during this time of unrest.

This unstable civil situation profoundly impacted the city even beyond the obvious issues of security and quality of life; economics and education suffered greatly as well. Many local business closed down due to pressure from the cartels, who wanted to extort money from locals to fund their war. This led to a very risky situation for the honest hard-working people who lived there; failure to cooperate meant risking their lives and the lives of their children. 

Luis’ description of the situation is surreal and offers a great deal of perspective, especially when heard as an observer who has been fortunate to never have had to worry about safety in these terms. Fortunately, in 2013 the situation started improving when the war started dying down for reasons that remain unclear. Life in *La Comarca Lagunera* is slowly returning to normal. Businesses are reopening and the nightlife is returning to how it used to be, leaving residents hopeful of returning to the good old days once again, and it seems that may be not too far in the future.	

##Web Development and Social Entrepreneurship

Luis was introduced to software development when he was in college. At that time, he was programming desktop applications in C++ and confesses that he didn't enjoy it very much. However, he developed an interest in web development when he was interning at the only electrical company in Mexico. He enjoyed using HTML, CSS, and PHP on some of their projects. However, this opportunity was short lived as he left the professional web development sphere to pursue a career in an unrelated field for the next five years. During this time, he managed to keep his connection to  web development alive and allow it to flourish by watching tutorials and building pet projects in his spare time. 

In 2014, having witnessed the terrible societal impact that the situation in his city had on the people around him, Luis was inspired to use his programming abilities to help alleviate the social issues around him. He later learned that this is called social entrepreneurship, and he discovered that he had found his true calling in this field.

Luis aims to harness the power of the web to eradicate problems his city faces in the areas of security, economics, and education among others. He realizes the impact the web can make to his city and is determined to see it come to fruition. He dreams of setting up a web development agency and one of his grand ideas involves building a platform to unite professionals who,  like him, wish to use their skills to help the social problems in the city. Keeping that at the forefront of his mind, he patiently works away at his daytime job and the assignments here at Modern Developer. He has a keen understanding that the current illusion of safety in the community may be fleeting, and he is eager to make the most of it while it lasts.

##Soccer and Down Time

In his spare time, Luis likes to relax with his family and friends, and he's quite the soccer aficionado. One of his early dreams was to be a professional soccer player, but despite being praised for his talent on the field, circumstances did not permit him to do so. These days, he enjoys playing a variant of traditional soccer, called Uruguay soccer (played with seven members on each team), which he plays regularly with his friends. In fact, there's currently a tournament going on in his city that he's enjoying. He and two of his best friends also maintain a YouTube channel on which they talk about La Liga MX, a soccer league in Mexico. His sports interests extend beyond soccer as well. He loves the NFL and his favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys, Roger Federer is his favorite Tennis player and he also enjoys watching baseball and basketball.

Apart from sports, he also enjoys playing video games and likes brewing his own beer. *"Maybe there's something entrepreneurial I can make out of [the beer] too..."*, he wonders.

When asked about his favorite experiences, he recalls that the most enjoyable experience he had was when he visited the beach with his family for the first time. He dreams of living by the beach some day and experiencing the sand, water and warm weather in his daily life. With the sheer courage he so casually during the writing of this article, it's not hard to imagine that these goals of his will one day be fulfilled.
